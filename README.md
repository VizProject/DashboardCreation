**Pizza Sales Report** 
**Project Overview**
This project presents a comprehensive Pizza Sales Report that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes sales data from a fictional pizza business. The report is built using various tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL to process, analyze, and display insights into the sales performance.

**The goal of the project is to:**

Track sales data across different regions, product types, and time periods.
Identify trends in customer purchasing behavior.
Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, units sold, average order value, and more.
Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

**Tools Used**
SQL: For data extraction and querying from the relational database.
Excel: For initial data cleaning, analysis, and basic reporting.
Power BI: For interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Tableau: For more advanced data visualizations and reporting.
**Data Sources**
The project uses a simulated sales database containing the following tables:

Sales: Contains records of each sale (OrderID, Date, ProductID, Quantity, TotalPrice, etc.).
Products: Information about the products sold (ProductID, ProductName, Category).
Customers: Data about customers (CustomerID, Name, Location, Email).
Regions: Details about the sales regions (RegionID, RegionName).
Time: Date and time dimensions for reporting (Date, Month, Year, DayOfWeek).

**Steps to Reproduce the Report**
1. SQL Data Extraction
Connect to the database containing the sales data.
Use the sales_queries.sql script to extract relevant data (such as sales by region, product, and time period).
2. Data Cleaning and Analysis in Excel
Open the Pizza_Sales_Report.xlsx file.
Perform basic data cleaning, such as:
Removing duplicates.
Handling missing values.
Correcting any inconsistencies in data (e.g., invalid product IDs or dates).
Perform basic analysis, such as:
Total sales by product, region, and month.
Revenue trends over time.
Customer segmentation based on purchase frequency.
3. Visualizing Data in Power BI
Open the Pizza_Sales_Report.pbix file in Power BI.
Load the cleaned sales data into Power BI.
Create interactive visualizations like:
Bar charts for sales by product or region.
Line charts for monthly sales trends.
Pie charts showing the share of sales by product category.
KPIs for metrics like Total Sales, Average Order Value, and Units Sold.
Use Power BI slicers to enable filtering by date, region, and product category.
4. Creating Dashboards in Tableau
Open the Pizza_Sales_Report.twbx file in Tableau.
Import the sales data and connect it to Tableau.
Build advanced visualizations such as:
Sales performance over time (e.g., by month or quarter).
Heatmaps showing the geographic distribution of sales.
Detailed product performance analysis.
Combine the visualizations into an interactive dashboard that allows users to drill down into specific data points, such as sales by region or customer demographics.

**Features of the Report**

Sales Overview: Displays total revenue, total units sold, and average order value.

Time Analysis: Insights into sales trends by day, week, month, or year.

Product Performance: Top-selling pizzas, average quantity sold, and revenue by product.

Regional Sales Breakdown: Compare sales performance across different geographic regions.

Customer Insights: Understanding of customer preferences and purchase frequency.

**How to Use the Report**
In Excel:
Open the Pizza_Sales_Report.xlsx file.
Review the Pivot Tables for summarized sales data.
Use filters to view data by product, region, or time period.
Modify the data or create additional analyses as needed.

In Power BI:
Open the Pizza_Sales_Report.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Refresh the data source if needed.
Use slicers to explore data by region, product, and time.
Interact with the visualizations to gain insights into the sales performance.

In Tableau:
Open the Pizza_Sales_Report.twbx file in Tableau Desktop.
Explore the interactive dashboard.
Apply filters to drill into specific regions or product categories.
Export reports or share the dashboard with stakeholders.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how to integrate SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau to create a comprehensive and interactive sales report for a pizza business. By leveraging the power of these tools, you can effectively analyze and visualize large datasets to uncover actionable insights that can inform business strategies and improve decision-making.
