SQL Server/MySQL (optional, if working with a relational database)
3. Steps in Each Tool
Excel
Import the Data: Open the .csv file(s) in Excel.
Data Cleaning:
Remove duplicates and fill in missing values.
Standardize date and time formats.
Exploratory Analysis:
Use PivotTables and charts to explore basic metrics like total sales, average order size, and product performance.
Export the Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned data as .csv for use in SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.
SQL
Import the Data: Load the cleaned .csv file into SQL as tables (e.g., Sales, Customers, Menu).
Data Transformation:
Write queries to transform raw data and create summary tables (e.g., total sales by month, top-selling pizzas).
Aggregate Data:
Perform joins between tables to enrich data.
Create views or tables to summarize metrics for use in Power BI and Tableau.
Export Results: Save the transformed data as .csv files for visualization.
Power BI
Import Data: Connect to the SQL database or import the .csv files created from Excel and SQL.
Data Modeling:
Define relationships between tables (e.g., linking sales with customer information).
Create Visuals:
Build visuals like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to display metrics such as monthly revenue, best-selling pizzas, and peak sales hours.
Design the Dashboard:
Arrange visuals on the Power BI dashboard for an interactive experience.
Publish: Publish the report to the Power BI service (optional).
Tableau
Import Data: Connect to the SQL database or use the .csv files.
Build Visualizations:
Create advanced visualizations such as heat maps for peak sales hours, customer demographic analysis, and monthly sales trends.
Dashboard Creation:
Combine multiple visualizations on a dashboard, adding filters and tooltips for interactivity.
Storytelling:
Use Tableauâ€™s Story feature to create a narrative around key findings.
Export & Share: Export the dashboard as a PDF or share it on Tableau Public (optional).

5. Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of pizza sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making in areas like menu planning, staffing, and marketing strategies. The findings from Power BI and Tableau dashboards are accessible to stakeholders for ongoing insights and performance monitoring.
