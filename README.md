Pizza Sales Report

Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data to provide insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and business trends. The report leverages data manipulation and visualization tools, including Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL, to explore key metrics such as revenue, order volume, top-selling items, peak hours, and customer demographics.

Tools Used:
 .Excel: Data cleaning, pre-processing, and initial exploratory analysis
 .SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and creation of summary tables
 .Power BI: Interactive data visualization and dashboard creation
 .Tableau: Advanced data visualizations and storytelling

1. Data Sources
The dataset used in this report includes:

 .Sales transactions: Details of individual pizza orders, such as date, time, pizza type, size, price, and quantity.
 .Customer information: Demographics and purchase history.
 .Pizza menu: Details about each pizza type, size, and pricing.
 
Note: This dataset is provided as a .csv file or through a SQL database connection.

2. Project Setup
  1. Clone the Repository (if applicable) or download the dataset files.
  2. Import the dataset into the required tools as described in each section below.
  3. Ensure you have the following software installed:
     .Microsoft Excel (version 2016 or later)
     .Power BI Desktop
     .Tableau Desktop
     .SQL Server/MySQL (optional, if working with a relational database)

3. Steps in Each Tool
Excel
  1. Import the Data: Open the .csv file(s) in Excel.
  2. Data Cleaning:
     .Remove duplicates and fill in missing values.
     .Standardize date and time formats.
  3. Exploratory Analysis:
     .Use PivotTables and charts to explore basic metrics like total sales, average order size, and product performance.
  4. Export the Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned data as .csv for use in SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.
SQL
  1. Import the Data: Load the cleaned .csv file into SQL as tables (e.g., Sales, Customers, Menu).
  2. Data Transformation:
     .Write queries to transform raw data and create summary tables (e.g., total sales by month, top-selling pizzas).
  3. Aggregate Data:
     .Perform joins between tables to enrich data.
     .Create views or tables to summarize metrics for use in Power BI and Tableau.
  4. Export Results: Save the transformed data as .csv files for visualization.
Power BI
  1. Import Data: Connect to the SQL database or import the .csv files created from Excel and SQL.
  2. Data Modeling:
     .Define relationships between tables (e.g., linking sales with customer information).
  3. Create Visuals:
     .Build visuals like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to display metrics such as monthly revenue, best-selling pizzas, and peak sales hours.
  4. Design the Dashboard:
     .Arrange visuals on the Power BI dashboard for an interactive experience.
  5. Publish: Publish the report to the Power BI service (optional).
Tableau
  1. Import Data: Connect to the SQL database or use the .csv files.
  2. Build Visualizations:
     .Create advanced visualizations such as heat maps for peak sales hours, customer demographic analysis, and monthly sales trends.
  3. Dashboard Creation:
     .Combine multiple visualizations on a dashboard, adding filters and tooltips for interactivity.
  4. Storytelling:
     .Use Tableauâ€™s Story feature to create a narrative around key findings.
  5. Export & Share: Export the dashboard as a PDF or share it on Tableau Public (optional).
     
4. Analysis Summary
This project aims to answer the following questions:

  .Which pizzas are the top-sellers?
  .What are the peak sales times?
  .How do different customer demographics affect purchase behavior?
  .What are the seasonal trends in pizza sales?
  
5. Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of pizza sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making in areas like menu planning, staffing, and marketing strategies. The findings from Power BI and Tableau dashboards are accessible to stakeholders for ongoing insights and performance monitoring.
